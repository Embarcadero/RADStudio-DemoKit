# EmojiDemo

Simple no-code project which shows FireMonkey support for Emoji and [Emoji ZWJ Sequences](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-zwj-sequence/).

An Emoji ZWJ Sequence is a specific combination of emojis,  joined with a [Zero Width Joiner](https://emojipedia.org/zero-width-joiner/) character, which display as a single emoji. The Zero Width Joiner (Codepoint U+200D), pronounced "zwidge", is not an emoji and has no appearance by itself. This is an invisible character when used alone.

## Examples:

# ♀️ + ⛹️= ⛹️‍♀️  

Individual emoji 👨Man, 👩 Woman, 👧 Girl, 👦 Boy

Combined as ZWJ Sequences:

* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦‍ Family: Man, Woman, Girl, Boy
* 👨‍👩‍👦 Family: Man, Woman, Boy
* 👨‍👩‍👧 Family: Man, Woman, Girl
* 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Family: Woman, Woman, Girl, Girl
