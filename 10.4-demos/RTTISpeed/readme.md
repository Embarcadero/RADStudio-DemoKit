# RTTISpeed

A project heavily based on RTTI ([DMVCFramework](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework) serializer) compiled with 10.4 Sydney is **30% faster** than the 10.3.3 Rio version. To avoid recompilation, there is also an image showing the numbers. Obviously absolute numbers are not as interesting as the proportions.
